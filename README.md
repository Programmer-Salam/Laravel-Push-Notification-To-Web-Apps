Laravel Web Push Notifications


This project is a Laravel-based web application that enables real-time notifications to be pushed to web clients. 

the application can send updates to clients in real-time, without the need for clients to constantly poll the server for new information.

To get started with this application, you will need to have a basic understanding of Laravel and web sockets and have an registered account with one-signal. You will also need to have a web server that supports web sockets.

To use this application, you can register as a user and start receiving real-time notifications. You can also customize the notifications that you receive by updating your notification preferences in your user profile.

This project was inspired by the need for real-time notifications in web applications. We would like to thank the Laravel and One signal communities for their contributions to the development of this application.
